# üß™ IoT-Based Sewage Monitoring System

## Project Overview üìà
This project presents an **IoT-based sewage monitoring system** designed to detect hazardous gases and monitor water levels in sewage environments. It aims to provide real-time alerts and data updates to concerned authorities, enhancing safety for sewage workers and facilitating timely municipal responses. The system integrates various sensors with an ESP32 microcontroller and utilizes the ThingSpeak IoT platform for data visualization and analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components & Hardware
The system is built using the following key components:

* [cite_start]**ESP32 Microcontroller**: The brain of the system, responsible for processing sensor data and managing communication. [cite: 1]
* **Gas Sensors**:
    * **MQ-136 (H2S Gas Sensor)**: Detects Hydrogen Sulfide.
    * **MQ-4 (Methane Gas Sensor)**: Detects Methane (CH4).
    * **MG-811 (CO2 Gas Sensor)**: Detects Carbon Dioxide (CO2).
    * **MQ-137 (NH3 Gas Sensor)**: Detects Ammonia (NH3).
* [cite_start]**DHT11/DHT22 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity. [cite: 1, 44]
* **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Detects water levels for overflow detection.
* **SIM900A GSM Module**: Enables SMS alerts to registered mobile numbers.
* **LCD Display (16x2)**: Shows real-time sensor readings and system status.
* **Buzzer**: Provides an audible alert for detected hazards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture
The system's architecture can be summarized as follows:

* **Sensing Layer**: Multiple gas sensors (CO2, Methane, H2S, NH3), a DHT11/DHT22 sensor, and an ultrasonic sensor collect environmental data from the sewage.
* [cite_start]**Processing Layer (ESP32)**: The ESP32 microcontroller processes the analog and digital inputs from the sensors[cite: 1]. [cite_start]It calculates distance from the ultrasonic sensor [cite: 16, 52] [cite_start]and reads temperature and humidity from the DHT sensor[cite: 16, 49].
* **Communication Layer**:
    * **ThingSpeak Integration**: Sensor data (gas levels, temperature, humidity, water level) is uploaded to the ThingSpeak IoT platform for live monitoring and historical data analysis.
    * **GSM Module**: In case of detected gas thresholds or critical events, the GSM module sends SMS alerts to predefined mobile numbers (e.g., sewage workers, municipality).
* **Alert & Display Layer**:
    * [cite_start]An **LCD** provides local, real-time display of sensor values and system status. [cite: 17, 18, 53, 54]
    * [cite_start]A **buzzer** provides immediate audible alerts when gas levels exceed safe thresholds. [cite: 42, 64, 70, 76]

The system flow is visually represented in the architectural diagram.

* [cite_start]**Audible Alarm**: Triggers a buzzer for immediate on-site alerts during hazardous conditions. [cite: 42, 64, 70, 76]
* [cite_start]**LCD Display**: Provides local, continuous display of all sensor readings. [cite: 17, 18, 53, 54]

## üíª Code Details
The project includes Arduino sketches for both Arduino-based and ESP32-based implementations:

* [cite_start]**`IoT Based Sewage Monitoring Using Arduino.txt`**: This code uses the Arduino platform[cite: 44]. [cite_start]It initializes the LCD [cite: 47][cite_start], DHT sensor [cite: 47][cite_start], buzzer [cite: 47][cite_start], and gas sensors[cite: 47]. [cite_start]It continuously reads sensor data [cite: 50, 51][cite_start], calculates water distance [cite: 52][cite_start], and updates ThingSpeak[cite: 55]. [cite_start]It also includes logic for sending SMS alerts [cite: 58, 65, 71, 77] [cite_start]and triggering the buzzer [cite: 64, 70, 76] [cite_start]if gas levels exceed predefined thresholds[cite: 57, 64, 70, 76].
* [cite_start]**`IoT Based Sewage Monitoring Using Esp32.txt`**: This code is specifically for the ESP32[cite: 1]. [cite_start]It uses `WiFi.h` [cite: 1] [cite_start]and `ThingSpeak.h` [cite: 1] for internet connectivity and data uploads. [cite_start]Similar to the Arduino version, it reads sensor data (gas, temperature, humidity, distance) [cite: 15, 16] [cite_start]and sends it to ThingSpeak[cite: 18, 19]. [cite_start]It also handles SMS alerts via AT commands to the GSM module when gas levels surpass set limits. [cite: 22, 23, 24, 25]
